=== Summary ===
An SQL Injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of an SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.
A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS filesystem and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Scan site with OWASP SQLiX
 * Scan site with Acunetix
 * Scan site with !NeXpose
  * If behind authentication, set up proxy to forward credentials (!WebScarab)
 * Manipulate parameters to determine if application is performing data sanitization
  * Look specifically for parameters that may be stored / accessed in a database
 * Check for blind injection
  * SQLMap for true/false blind
  * SQLNinja for time-based blind

=== Additional Tools ===
 * SQLIer
  * SQLIer takes a vulnerable URL and attempts to determine all the necessary information to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability by itself, requiring no user interaction at all. 
 * SQLbftools
  * SQLbftools is a collection of tools to retrieve MySQL information available using a blind SQL Injection attack.
 * SQL Injection Brute-forcer
  * SQLibf is a tool for automatizing the work of detecting and exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities. SQLibf can work in Visible and Blind SQL Injection. It works by doing simple logic SQL operations to determine the exposure level of the vulnerable application. Get SQLLibf.
 * SQLBrute
  * SQLBrute is a tool for brute forcing data out of databases using blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. It supports time based and error based exploit types on Microsoft SQL Server, and error based exploit on Oracle. It is written in Python, uses multi-threading, and doesn’t require non-standard libraries.
 * !BobCat
  * !BobCat is a tool to aid an auditor in taking full advantage of SQL injection vulnerabilities. It is based on !AppSecInc research. It can list the linked severs, database schema, and allow the retrieval of data from any table that the current application user has access to.
 * SQLMap
  * SQLMap is an automatic blind SQL injection tool, developed in python, capable to perform an active database management system fingerprint, enumerate entire remote databases and much more. The aim of SQLMap is to implement a fully functional database management system tool which takes advantages of web application programming security flaws which lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
 * Absinthe
  * Absinthe is a GUI-based tool that automates the process of downloading the schema and contents of a database that is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection. Get Absinthe.
 * SQL Injection Pen-testing Tool
  * The SQL Injection Tool is a GUI-based utility designed to examine database through vulnerabilities in web-applications.
 * SQID
  * SQL Injection digger (SQLID) is a command line program that looks for SQL injections and common errors in websites. It can perform the follwing operations: look for SQL injection in a web pages and test submit forms for possible SQL injection vulnerabilities.
 * Blind SQL Injection Perl Tool
  * bsqlbf is a Perl script that lets auditors retrieve information from web sites that are vulnerable to SQL Injection.
 * SQL Power Injection Injector
  * SQL Power Injection helps the penetration tester to inject SQL commands on a web page. It’s main strength is its capacity to automate tedious blind SQL injection with several threads. Get SQL Power Injection.
 * FJ-Injector Framwork
  * FG-Injector is a free open source framework designed to help find SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It includes a proxy feature for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests, and an interface for automating SQL injection exploitation.
 * Automagic SQL Injector
  * The Automagic SQL Injector is an automated SQL injection tool designed to help save time on penetration testing. It is only designed to work with vanilla Microsoft SQL injection holes where errors are returned..
 * NGSS SQL Injector
  * NGSS SQL Injector exploit vulnerabilities in SQL injection on disparate database servers to gain access to stored data. It currently supports the following databases: Access, DB2, Informix, MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Sysbase.
