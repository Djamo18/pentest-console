=== Summary ===
Many XML applications are invoked by passing them parameters using HTTP GET queries. These are sometimes known as Ã¢REST-style" Web Services (REST = Representational State Transfer). These Web Services can be attacked by passing malicious content on the HTTP GET string (e.g. extra long parameters (2048 chars), SQL statements/injection (or OS Injection parameters).

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Determine if the application is using RESTful web services
 * Determine if the application is sanitizing requests
  * Exact Match, Known Good, Known Bad (in that order)
 * If vulnerable vectors are found, exploit them using common attack patterns (injection, manipulation, overflow)
