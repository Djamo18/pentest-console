=== Summary ===
There are several different vendors and versions of web servers on the market today. Knowing the type of web server that you are testing significantly helps in the testing process, and will also change the course of the test. This information can be derived by sending the web server specific commands and analyzing the output, as each version of web server software may respond differently to these commands.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Send a HEAD command to the web server:  {{{HEAD / HTTP/1.0}}}
  * Use [http://www.tomdns.net/content.php?do=webheader TomDNS] to query the server 
 * Use httprint to fingerprint server.
 * Use nmap to fingerprint server.
 * Use netcraft (http://www.netcraft.com) to determine information about the server.
