==== Summary ====
In this test we check that the web server is not configured to allow potentially dangerous HTTP commands (methods) and that Cross Site Tracing (XST) is not possible

==== Specific Steps ====
 * Determine the HTTP verbs allowed on the server by issuing an OPTIONS command
{{{ 
OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
Host:www.target
}}}
  * Possibly dangerous methods
   * TRACE - Requires a client, or server-side vulnerability to exploit, but indicates the server is succeptible to XST
   * PUT - Indicates the server would allow a user to upload files
   * DELETE - Indicates the server would allow a user to delete files
   * CONNECT - The server may be able to be used as a proxy
 * Check for WebDAV extensions
