=== Summary ===
While most applications require authentication for gaining access to private information or to execute tasks, not every authentication method is able to provide adequate security.

Negligence, ignorance or simple understatement of security threats often result in authentication schemes that can be bypassed by simply skipping the login page and directly calling an internal page that is supposed to be accessed only after authentication has been performed.

In addition to this, it is often possible to bypass authentication measures by tampering with requests and tricking the application into thinking that we're already authenticated. This can be accomplished either by modifying the given URL parameter or by manipulating the form or by counterfeiting sessions. 

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Request pages that are known to require authentication
 * Examine page parameters to determine if authorization is a fixed parameter
  * For example, there may be a parameter: page.asp?authenticated=no
 * Determine if Session IDs can be brute forced
 * Try (SQL) injection on login page to bypass authentication
