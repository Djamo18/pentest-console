=== Summary ===
The DB listener is the entry point for remote connections to a database. It listens for connection requests and handles them accordingly. It is important to test for open DB connection ports. If an attacker were able to connect and authenticate, they would have access to sensitive data, without the restrictions imposed by the application.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Check for Oracle: TCP/1521, TCP/2483, TCP/2484
 * Check for MySQL: TCP/3306
 * Check for Postgres: TCP/5432
 * Check for SQL Server: TCP/1433
 * Perform full nmap scan to examine other ports
