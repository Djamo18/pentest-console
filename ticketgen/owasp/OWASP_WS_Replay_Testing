=== Summary ===
This section describes testing replay vulnerabilities of a web service. The threat for a replay attack is that the attacker can assume the identity of a valid user and commit some nefarious act without detection.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Determine if traffic can be intercepted (MiTM)
  * Is the application consistently using SSL?
 * If a request is sent to a web service, is the response predictable?
  * Are there mitigations in place for CSRF attacks?
