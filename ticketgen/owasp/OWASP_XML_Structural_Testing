=== Summary ===
XML, to function properly needs to be well-formed. XML which is not well-formed shall fail when parsed by the XML parser on the server side. A parser needs to run thorough the entire xml message in a serial manner in order to assess the XML well-formedness.

An XML parser is also very CPU labour intensive. Some attack vectors exploit this weakness by sending very large or malformed xml messages.

Attackers can create XML documents which are structured in such a way as to create a denial of service attack on the receiving server by tying up memory and CPU resources. This occurs via overloading the XML parser which is very CPU intensive in any case. 

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Determine portions of the application that process XML 
 * Send malformed XML to the application
  * Remove a tag
  * Remove an attribute
 * Send abnormally long or short XML to the application
 * Can binary attachments be added?
