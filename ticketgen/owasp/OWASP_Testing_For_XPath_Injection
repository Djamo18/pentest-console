=== Summary ===
XPath is a language that has been designed and developed to operate on data that is described with XML. The XPath injection allows an attacker to inject XPath elements in a query that uses this language. Some of the possible goals are to bypass authentication or access information in an unauthorized manner.The XPath attack pattern was first published by Amit Klein and is very similar to the usual SQL Injection.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Discover vectors that are likely to be stored in an XML file / database
 * Determine if XPath is used to query XML / DB
  * Enter a single quote (') to determine if application is susceptible to injection
