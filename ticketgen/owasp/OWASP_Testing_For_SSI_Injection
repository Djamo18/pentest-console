=== Summary ===
Web servers usually give to the developer the possibility to add small pieces of dynamic code inside static html pages, without having to play with full-fledged server-side or client-side languages. This feature is incarnated by the Server-Side Includes (SSI), a very simple extensions that can enable an attacker to inject code into html pages, or even perform remote code execution.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Determine if server allows SSI
  * Usually, this is a yes.
  * Look for .shtml files (though their discovery isn't necessary)
 * Determine possible input vectors for SSI
  * Cookies
  * Headers
  * GET / POST parameters
 * Exploit discovered vectors
