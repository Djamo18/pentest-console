=== Summary ===
In order to avoid continuous authentication for each page of a website or service, web applications implement various mechanisms to store and validate credentials for a pre-determined timespan.

These mechanisms are known as Session Management and while they're most important in order to increase the ease of use and user-friendliness of the application, they can be exploited by a pen tester to gain access to a user account without the need to provide correct credentials

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Ensure that session management exists
  * Determine the parameters used to manage sessions
  * Determine when and how credentials are being passed
 * Perform Session Analysis (using Burp Suite). Check for:
  * Randomness / Uniqueness
  * Information Leakage / Direct Object Reference
  * Encryption Issues (Encoding as Encryption)
 * Brute force any Session ID's that appear predictable
  * Make sure to check cookies, parameters, post data, etc
