==== Summary ====
Web based PL/SQL applications are enabled by the PL/SQL Gateway - it is the component that translates web requests into database queries. Oracle has developed a number of different software implementations however ranging from the early web listener product to the Apache mod_plsql module to the XML Database (XDB) web server. All have their own quirks and issues each of which will be thoroughly investigated in this paper. Products that use the PL/SQL Gateway include, but are not limited to, the Oracle HTTP Server, eBusiness Suite, Portal, HTMLDB, WebDB and Oracle Application Server. 

==== Specific Steps ====
 * Determine if application uses Oracle as backend DB (and likely, PL/SQL)
  * Examine form of URL. Look for similar URLS (where xyz is the DAD):
{{{
http://www.example.com/pls/xyz
http://www.example.com/xyz/owa
http://www.example.com/xyz/plsql
}}}
 * Examine server headers for "Oracle"
 * Test for valid / invalid Oracle query:
{{{
http://www.example.com/pls/dad/null - should work, 200
http://www.example.com/pls/dad/nosuchproc - shouldn't work, 404
}}}
 * Perform SQL injection with Oracle-specific syntax
