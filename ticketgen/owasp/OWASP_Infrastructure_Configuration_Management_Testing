=== Summary ===
The intrinsic complexity of interconnected and heterogeneous web server infrastructure, which can count hundreds of web applications, makes configuration management and review a fundamental step in testing and deploying every single application. In fact it takes only a single vulnerability to undermine the security of the entire infrastructure, and even small and (almost) unimportant problems may evolve into severe risks for another application on the same server. In order to address these problems, it is of utmost importance to perform an in-depth review of configuration and known security issues.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Determine all administrative interfaces.
 * Determine if administrative interfaces are available from an internal network or are also available from the Internet.
 * If available from the Internet, determine the mechanisms that control access to these interfaces and their associated susceptibilities.
 * Check for default user & password. 

=== Notes ===
Application has a complex role-based security infrastructure. No external administrative interfaces are known.

Possible roles:
 * Domain Manager
 * Administrator
 * Supervisor
 * Instructor
 * User

Note that these roles can be cus
