=== Summary ===
Code Injection testing involves a tester submitting code as input that is processed by the web server as dynamic code or as an included file. These tests can target various server-side scripting engines, i.e. ASP, PHP, etc. Proper validation and secure coding practices need to be employed to protect against these attacks.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Examine application for references to code files that are processed by the runtime
 * Examine application for parameters that may be executed
 * If access to the code is provide, examine for:
  * Server.Execute (ASP)
  * exec, system (PHP, Perl)
  * ...
