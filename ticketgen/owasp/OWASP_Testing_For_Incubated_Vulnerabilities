=== Summary ===
Also often referred to as persistent attacks, incubated testing is a complex testing that needs more than one data validation vulnerability to work. In this section we describe a set of examples to test an Incubated Vulnerability.

 * The attack vector needs to be persisted in the first place, it needs to be stored in the persistence layer, and this would only occur if weak data validation was present or that arrived into the system via another channel such as an admin console or directly via a backend batch process.
 * Secondly once the attack vector was "recalled" the vector would need to be executed successfully. For example an incubated XSS attack would require weak output validation so the script would be delivered to the client in its executable form. 

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Examine application for places to store commands and data
  * Stored XSS is a common type of incubated vulnerability
  * File upload can provide another vector
 * Exploitation generally requires
  * A lack of input / output validation
  * Creativity. Determine if attacks can be stored in the application and recalled later (through another vector).
