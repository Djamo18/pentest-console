=== Summary ===
Due to historical exporting restrictions of high grade cryptography, legacy and new web servers could be able to handle a weak cryptographic support.

Even if high grade ciphers are normally used and installed, some misconfiguration in server installation could be used to force the use of a weaker cipher to gain access to the supposed secure communication channel. 

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Use !NeXpose results to examine errors with certificates
 * Use SSLDigger to check SSL Versions
 * Use nmap to determine SSL-Wrapped Services  {{{ nmap -sV <target> }}} 
 * Scan server with nessus
 * Check for expired certificate
