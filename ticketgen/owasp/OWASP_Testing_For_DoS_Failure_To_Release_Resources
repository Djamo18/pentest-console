=== Summary ===
With this test, we check that the application properly releases resources (files and/or memory) after they have been used.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Determine (or hypothesize) the resources the application is consuming: 
  * Disk  space 
   * Configuration
   * Data
   * Logs
  * Database connections 
  * Memory
   * Object Storage
 * Manipulate each vector of possible resource consumption.
  * Consider
   * Memory Leaks
   * Logging wrap-arounds
   * Filled-disk conditions
