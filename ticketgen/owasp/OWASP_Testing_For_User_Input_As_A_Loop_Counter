=== Summary ===
In this test we check whether it is possible to force the application to loop through a code segment that needs high computing resources, in order to decrease its overall performance.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Determine if the application provides functionality with a user-specified number of iterations
 * Manipulate vectors to modify (increase) number of iterations an action is performed

=== Notes ===
