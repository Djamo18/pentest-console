=== Summary ===
In this section we test for format string attacks that can be used to crash a program or to execute harmful code. The problem stems from the use of unfiltered user input as the format string parameter in certain C functions that perform formatting, such as printf().

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Fuzz application vectors with payloads of abnormal size, content, or taste.
  * Attempt to hit 'edge cases' of the application.
