=== Summary ===
ORM Injection is an attack using SQL Injection against an ORM generated data access object model. From the point of view of a tester, this attack is virtually identical to a SQL Injection attack. However, the injection vulnerability exists in code generated by the ORM tool.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Look for references to Hibernate (Java) or !ActiveRecord (Ruby)
 * Testing for ORM Injection is identical to testing for SQL Injection
