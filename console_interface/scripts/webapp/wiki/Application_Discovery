=== Summary ===

A paramount step for testing for web application vulnerabilities is to find out which particular applications are hosted on a web server.
Many different applications have known vulnerabilities and known attack strategies that can be exploited in order to gain remote control and/or data exploitation.
In addition to this, many applications are often misconfigured or not updated due to the perception that they are only used "internally" and therefore no threat exists.
Furthermore, many applications use a common path for administrative interfaces which can be used to guess or brute force administrative passwords.

=== Specific Steps ===

 * Check for non-standard base URL
 * Check for non-standard port
 * Check for virtual hosting by correlating DNS
 * Use reverse IP search to find virtual hosts:

  * http://search.msn.com  - syntax: "ip:x.x.x.x"
