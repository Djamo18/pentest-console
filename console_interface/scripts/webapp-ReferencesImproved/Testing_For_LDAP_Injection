=== Summary ===
LDAP is an acronym for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. It is a paradigm to store informations about users, hosts and many other objects. LDAP Injection is a server side attack, which could allow sensitive information about users and hosts represented in an LDAP structure to be disclosed, modified or inserted.
This is done by manipulating input parameters afterwards passed to internal search,add and modify functions.
