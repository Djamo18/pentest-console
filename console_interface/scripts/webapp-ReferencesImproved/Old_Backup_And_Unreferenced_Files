=== Summary ===
While most of the files within a web server are directly handled by the server itself it isn't uncommon to find unreferenced and/or forgotten files that can be used to obtain important information about either the infrastructure or the credentials.
Most common scenario include the presence of renamed old version of modified files, inclusion files that are loaded into the language of choice and can be downloaded as source or even automatic or manual backups in form of compressed archives. Backup files can also be generated automatically by the underlying filesytem your application is hosted on, a feature usually referred to as "snapshots".
All these files may grant the pentester access to inner workings, backdoors, administrative interfaces or even credentials to connect to the administrative interface or the database server.
