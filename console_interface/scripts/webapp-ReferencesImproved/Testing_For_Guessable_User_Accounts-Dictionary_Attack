=== Summary ===
Today's web application typically runs on popular software, open source or commercial, that is installed on servers and requires configuration or customization by the server administrator. In addition, most of today's hardware appliances, i.e. network routers, database servers, etc., offer web-based configurations or administrative interfaces.

Often, these applications are not properly configured and the default credentials provided for authentication are never updated.
These default username/password combinations are widely known by penetration testers and malicious hackers that can use them to gain access to the internal network infrastructure and/or to gain privileges and steal data.
This problem applies to software and/or appliances that provide built-in non-removable accounts and, in fewer cases, uses blank passwords as default credentials.
