=== Summary ===
Cross Site Scripting is one of the most common application level attacks. Cross Site Scripting is abbreviated XSS to avoid confusion with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Testing for XSS frequently results in a JavaScript alert window being displayed to the user, which may minimize the importance of the finding. However, the alert window should be interpreted as a signal that an attacker has the ability to run arbitrary code.

The application is analyzed for the three types of XSS:
 * DOM-Based
 * Stored
 * Reflected
