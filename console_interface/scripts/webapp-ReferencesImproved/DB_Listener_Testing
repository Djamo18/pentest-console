=== Summary ===
The DB listener is the entry point for remote connections to an Oracle database. It listens for connection requests and handles them accordingly. This test is possible if the tester can access to this service -- the test should be done from the Intranet (major Oracle installations don't expose this service to the external network). The listener, by default, listens on port 1521(port 2483 is the new officially registered port for the TNS Listener and 2484 for the TNS Listener using SSL). It is a good practice to change the listener from this port to another arbitrary port number. If this listener is "turned off" remote access to the database is not possible. If this is the case ones application would fail also creating a denial of service attack.
