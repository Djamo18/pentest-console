=== Summary ===
Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) is one of the latest techniques used by web application developers to provide a user experience similar to that of a local application. Since AJAX is still a new technology, there are many security issues that have not yet been fully researched. Some of the security issues in AJAX include:

 * Increased attack surface with many more inputs to secure
 * Exposed internal functions of the application
 * Client access to third-party resources with no built-in security and encoding mechanisms
 * Failure to protect authentication information and sessions
 * Blurred line between client-side and server-side code, resulting in security mistakes
