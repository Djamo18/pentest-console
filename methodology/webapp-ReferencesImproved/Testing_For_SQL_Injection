=== Summary ===
An SQL Injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of an SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.
A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS filesystem and in some cases issue commands to the operating system.
