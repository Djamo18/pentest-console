=== Summary ===
Business logic comprises:

 *  Business rules that express business policy (such as channels, location, logistics, prices, and products); and
 *  Workflows that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant (a person or a software system) to another. 

The attacks on the business logic of an application are dangerous, difficult to detect and specific to that application
