=== Summary ===
Several web applications allow users to reset their password if they have forgotten it, usually by sending them a password reset email and/or by asking them to answer one or more "security questions". In this test we check that this function is properly implemented and that it does not introduce any flaw in the authentication scheme. We also check whether the application allows the user to store the password in the browser ("remember password" function).
