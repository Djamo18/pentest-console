=== Summary ===
Due to historical exporting restrictions of high grade cryptography, legacy and new web servers could be able to handle a weak cryptographic support.

Even if high grade ciphers are normally used and installed, some misconfiguration in server installation could be used to force the use of a weaker cipher to gain access to the supposed secure communication channel.
