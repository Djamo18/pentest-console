=== Summary ===
File extensions are commonly used in web servers to easily determine which technologies / languages / plugins must be used to fulfill the web request.

While this behavior is consistent with RFCs and Web Standards, using standard file extensions provides the pentester useful information about the underlying technologies used in a web appliance and greatly simplifies the task of determining the attack scenario to be used on peculiar technologies.

In addition to this misconfiguration in web servers could easily reveal confidential information about access credentials.
