=== Summary ===
We analyze two different attacks that target specific HTTP headers: HTTP splitting and HTTP smuggling. The first attack exploits a lack of input sanitization which allows an intruder to insert CR and LF characters into the headers of the application response and to 'split' that answer into two different HTTP messages. The goal of the attack can vary from a cache poisoning to cross site scripting. In the second attack, the attacker exploits the fact that some specially crafted HTTP messaged can be parsed and interpreted in different ways depending on the agent that receives them. HTTP smuggling requires some level of knowledge about the different agents that are handling the HTTP messages (web server, proxy, firewall) and therefore will be included only in a Gray / White Box situation.
