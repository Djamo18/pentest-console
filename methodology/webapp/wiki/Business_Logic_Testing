=== Summary ===
Business logic comprises:

 *  Business rules that express business policy (such as channels, location, logistics, prices, and products); and
 *  Workflows that are the ordered tasks of passing documents or data from one participant (a person or a software system) to another. 

The attacks on the business logic of an application are dangerous, difficult to detect and specific to that application

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Understand the application
  * Attain, or generate all application business scenarios
  * Generate application workflows
  * Attain all user roles / groups / departments
   * Access rights of the various roles / groups / departments
  * Generate a privilege table
 * Test the application with a full understanding of functionality
  * Use the privilege table to generate specific tests for each role / group / department
  * Ensure proper handling of special user action sequences
  * Cover all business transaction paths
  * Ensure business logic is not happening client-side
