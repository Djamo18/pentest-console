Web servers usually give to the developer the possibility to add small pieces of dynamic code inside static html pages, without having to play with full-fledged server-side or client-side languages. This feature is incarnated by the Server-Side Includes (SSI), a very simple extensions that can enable an attacker to inject code into html pages, or even perform remote code execution.
