=== Summary ===
Today's web applications typically run on popular software that is installed on servers and requires configuration or customization by the server administrator. In addition, most of today's hardware appliances, i.e. network routers, database servers, etc., offer web-based configurations or administrative interfaces.

Often, these applications are not properly configured and the default credentials provided for authentication are never updated.
These default username/password combinations are widely known by penetration testers and malicious hackers that can use them to gain access to the internal network infrastructure and/or to gain privileges and steal data.
 

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Examine application for indication of password policy.
 * Does the application create users? Are they generated by an administrator?
  * How are passwords created?
 * Try simple generic password combinations: 
  * Example Users: "admin", "administrator", "root", "system", "guest", "operator", "super", "qa", "test", "test1", "testing", "guest"
  * Example Passwords: "password", "pass123", "password123", "admin", or "guest"
  * Make sure to try blank passwords!
 * Try users named after the application
  * If the application is named "foo", try foo/foo, or foo/bar, or bar/foo
 * Try contact names
 * Try enumerated users
 * Try logical passwords such as area sports teams

 * If source code is available, examine for hardcoded users / passwords and password policy / ability to subvert
