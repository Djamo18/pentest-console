=== Summary ===
Brute-forcing consists of systematically enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each candidate satisfies the problem's statement. In web application testing, the problem we are going to face with the most is very often connected with the need of having a valid user account to access the inner part of the application. Therefore we are going to check different types of authentication schema and the effectiveness of different brute-force attacks.

=== Specific Steps ===
 * Generate a specific list of usernames & passwords
 * Determine authentication method
  * Basic  / Digest Authentication
   * Use Hydra
  * Forms Authentication
   * Use Hydra
   * Use Burp Suite
