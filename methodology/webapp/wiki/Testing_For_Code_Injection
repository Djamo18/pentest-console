=== Summary ===
Code Injection testing involves a tester submitting code as input that is processed by the web server as dynamic code or as an included file. These tests can target various server-side scripting engines, i.e. ASP, PHP, etc. Proper validation and secure coding practices need to be employed to protect against these attacks.
