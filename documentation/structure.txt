directory structure

/var/ptc - main application directory - all files go here if they're not in other locations for various reasons - includes documentation & reportgen / attack platform
 - /var/ptc/attackPlatform

 - /var/ptc/deploy - deployment / removal scripts

/var/trac-archive - archived trac projects

/var/svn - svn projects

/var/svn-archive - archived svn projects

/etc/trac - trac systemwide configuration directory (maybe move under /etc/ptc?)
