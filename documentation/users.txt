so... i'm thinking permission are a major issue

it might make sense to create a ptc user, let them run the websever, and give them access to all teh necessessary ptc directories as part of the deployment. 

can we split up www-data / ptc?

there definitely needs to be a ptc group at this point. ptc-admins, maybe?

ooph, directory structure is going to be important
