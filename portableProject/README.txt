The purpose of these scripts is to take a trac project and make a portable version. That means, import and export into a trac server. There are multiple things to take in & out:

 - Wiki Pages
 - Tickets
 - Subversion Repository
 - Administrivia
  - Milestones
   - with dates?
  - Ticket Types
  - Ticket Closing Messages
  - Priorities
  - Severities

What about the trac.ini file? There is very likely to be customization in this file which will not translate well. (imports / exports, version issues, etc)

This may be a pain in the ass to do through the RPC interface. we will see...


well, why not just zip & provide the /svn & /trac?
 - users? - are they the same on the new box
 - configuration of the trac server on the new box...
 


what's ideal
 - provide the server / projectname / creds for a ptc (trac) project & have it download to a "portable format
 - then, use the same script (with a different server /creds / projectname & have it upload... 

cluge is to just copy the project - takes a lot of effing around... :/
