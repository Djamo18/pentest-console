Pentest Console

This project was a mashup of a project-tracking tool (trac) and workflow / utility scripts which helped streamline the reporting processes during a pentest. If you're interested in this project, check out Metasploit Pro (http://www.metasploit.com/) or Dradis (http://dradisframework.org/).

Many of the ideas here are better implmented in these projects. Specifically: 

* Parsers for common security tools (nexpose, nessus, acunetix, burp, etc)
* Document generation
* Pre-built findings
* Pentest tool automation
* Vulnerabilty analysis
